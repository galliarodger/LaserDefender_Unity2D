# LaserDefender_Unity2D
A simple Laser Defender game, in which the core mechanic is shooting enemies and dodging bullets.  The game's core loop is a single level of endless play in which the player shoots enemies for points until the player runs out of health.
These are my scripts used in creating my Laser Defender Game.
